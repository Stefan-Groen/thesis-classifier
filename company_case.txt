Case Biclou Prestige
Biclou Prestige SARL, or Biclou for short, is a road bike manufacturer founded in 1960 in
France by Louis Levieux. Over the years, Biclou has become a well-known brand,
supplying bikes at the forefront of professional cycling. For more than fifty years, the
company was run by the Levieux family. However, in 2012, it underwent a management
buyout led by Véronique Vitessier. With a focus on increasing market share, Vitessier
aimed to preserve Biclou’s innovative spirit while expanding its range with more
affordable models to boost sales and attract a broader audience.
Overall, Vitessier’s vision for Biclou turned out to be a success. It now sells road bikes to
a range of consumers, from elite cyclists to amateur enthusiasts. During the COVID-19
pandemic, the company experienced a surge in demand, particularly in Western Europe,
as more consumers took up cycling—both for its health benefits and as a way to make
use of newfound flexibility from remote work. However, already in 2023, demand in
Western Europe started plateauing and is now returning to pre-COVID-19 levels. In
addition, in Southern and Eastern Europe, Biclou has struggled to gain traction, where
lower-cost alternatives dominate. Expanding into these regions is a key priority, aligning
with Vitessier’s strategy to grow market share.
To reach consumers, Biclou relies on a network of retailers. Retailers stock a range of
models, from the entry-level Pétard Mouillé to the mid-range Chasse Patate to the high-
performance Échappée Royale series, catering to cyclists of all levels. Beyond amateur
riders, Biclou has also cemented its reputation in professional cycling through its
sponsorship of Cofidis, a UCI WorldTour team known for its relentless breakaway
attempts, particularly in French races. As the team’s official bike sponsor since 1980,
Biclou provides cutting-edge racing bikes designed in close collaboration with Cofidis
riders and technical staff. Vitessier considers this partnership a cornerstone of Biclou’s
brand, reinforcing its identity as a high-performance innovator while showcasing its
engineering on the sport’s biggest stages. With the sponsorship contract running until
2026, Biclou remains committed to refining its bikes to meet the evolving demands of
professional racing, hoping to secure an extension and maintain its presence in the
peloton for years to come.
Biclou’s demand is split between two main groups: Cofidis and consumer sales. While
Cofidis accounts for only a small portion of total production output, its orders receive
priority handling, with deliveries required within 72 hours. Demand from Cofidis remains
relatively stable throughout the year, with predictable peaks before the Giro d’Italia, Tour
de France, and Vuelta a España, as well as during new model rollouts. Consumer
demand, in contrast, is more volatile, following a seasonal pattern with peak sales in
spring and early summer, tapering off in autumn and winter. To anticipate demand, Biclou
relies on quantitative forecasting models that analyse historical sales trends, adjusted by
manual input from the sales team. These adjustments reflect expected industry trends,
large sports events, and insights from retailer conversations, ensuring forecasts align
with anticipated market conditions. Once final demand predictions are set by the sales
team, the operations team uses them to plan production schedules and procurement.

Biclou’s supply chain
Biclou’s road bikes are assembled in France, but their production depends on a carefully
selected network of suppliers. Road bike producers, like Biclou, rely on complex global
supply chains for materials and components. Most modern road bikes use lightweight
materials (e.g., carbon composites and aluminium alloys) for their frames and
components sourced from specialized suppliers around the world. Many Tier-1 suppliers
rely on Tier-2 and Tier-3 suppliers, meaning disruptions at any level can impact final
production and assembly in France. Lead times are extremely long, with some
components needing to be ordered many months in advance to ensure availability. The
cycling industry is heavily clustered in East Asia where many parts are manufactured.
Taiwan is the premier hub of original equipment manufacturers – the city of Taichung and
surrounding area host hundreds of bike industry factories. Taiwan alone has over 900
bicycle-related companies, employing more than 32,000 people.
Frame production
Biclou’s entry-level Pétard Mouillé is built using aluminium alloy frames sourced from
Niuaero in China. Biclou’s mid-range Chasse Patate and high-performance Échappée
Royale rely on advanced carbon fibre frames. These are sourced from two of the largest
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in the industry: Kenstone Metal and Giant
Manufacturing, both located in Taiwan. Giant Manufacturing not only sells under their
own brand but also produce frames on contract for many Western brands.
High-end frame factories source prepreg carbon fibre (carbon sheets pre-impregnated
with resin) from Japanese firms like Toray, Toho Tenax, and Mitsubishi Rayon, which
dominate the global carbon fibre market. Prepreg carbon sheets are precisely cut and
layered into moulds based on Biclou’s specifications. The carbon layers are baked in
autoclaves under high pressure to create a strong, lightweight structure. The cured
frames undergo precision CNC machining, sanding, and drilling to prepare for assembly.
Frames are weighed, impact-tested, and scanned for imperfections before shipment to
France.
Component sourcing
Biclou sources most components from Asia. Shimano has been a key supply partner of
Biclou. Before 2020, it was Biclou’s only supplier of groupsets – consisting of the shifters,
derailleurs, crankset, chain, cassette, and brakes. Shimano has had roughly 70% of the
global market share in bike gears and brakes. It produces components across a network
of factories in Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, and China, ensuring volume supply. During
COVID-19 its production got severely disrupted, causing headaches for Biclou’s
production planning. Since then, Biclou also sources some groupsets from SRAM (USA)
and recently started discussions with Campagnolo (Italy).
Some other key supply partnerships include DT Swiss (Taiwan) and Mavic (France) for
wheelsets, Schwalbe (Germany) and Maxxis (Taiwan) for tires, and Selle Royal (Italy) and
Velo Enterprise (Taiwan) for saddles and handlebars. Biclou further sources numerous
smaller components – headsets and bearings, braking rotors and pads for disc brake
models, cables and housing and bar tape. Even these smaller items often trace back to a
few sources worldwide. For example, most ball bearings in bikes come from
manufacturers in Germany specializing in precision bearings.

Biclou’s production
Once frames and components arrive in France, Biclou takes over the final steps of
production at its facility. Biclou’s production team installs drivetrains, handlebars,
wheelsets, and braking systems, transforming bare frames into fully functional bikes.
Before shipping, every bike undergoes a comprehensive check, including gear shifting
precision, brake performance and alignment, and frame integrity and weight verification.
For consumer models, a random sample is pulled for full structural testing to ensure
consistency. Unlike consumer bikes, Cofidis team frames arrive unpainted and receive
their official team livery in France. Biclou’s facility applies custom paint jobs and sponsor
decals. It also makes team-specific modifications (e.g., cockpit adjustments).
Biclou maintains a small-scale workshop where its engineering team tests new designs
before production. This setup allows for material and aerodynamics prototyping,
validating new frame geometries, and component fit testing to ensure compatibility
between different supplier parts. It also supports pre-production evaluations, allowing
Biclou to refine designs before committing to large-scale manufacturing runs in East Asia.
By keeping engineering, testing, and quality control in-house, Biclou ensures its bikes
meet the highest performance standards while benefiting from the specialized
manufacturing expertise of its suppliers.

Organizational structure
Biclou’s executive board is tightly involved in both strategic direction and day-to-day
operations. Véronique Vitessier serves as CEO and largest shareholder, supported by a
Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), Chief Operations Officer (COO), and Chief Financial
Officer (CFO)—all of whom also hold shares following the management buyout. The COO
is responsible for production and supply chain operations, overseeing Biclou’s 400-
person production team, a 6-person procurement team handling global supplier
coordination, and a logistics and inventory unit ensuring material flows align with
assembly schedules. The CCO leads a 25-person sales and marketing team, managing
retailer partnerships, customer service, and brand positioning, while also overseeing the
20-person R&D team, which focuses on product development. The CFO manages
financial strategy, budgeting, and cost control, leading a 25-person finance team, while
also overseeing a 5-person sustainability unit focused on sustainability initiatives and
regulatory compliance. Corporate support functions, including HR, legal, and IT, report
directly to the CEO.
Biclou’s relationship with Cofidis is managed across multiple teams and roles. The CCO
oversees sponsorship agreements, ensuring the partnership strengthens Biclou’s brand
and aligns with its marketing strategy. The R&D team works closely with Cofidis riders and
mechanics, incorporating race feedback into future product innovation. The COO
ensures that team bikes are delivered on schedule, coordinating with production to meet
professional-level specifications.
The executive board meets formally on a biweekly basis, with additional strategy sessions
scheduled around major developments, such as new product launches. These meetings
serve as a checkpoint to align production schedules with sales forecasts, evaluate
financial performance, and discuss ongoing R&D efforts. In practice, however, the lines
between functions are often blurred – issues that arise in production quickly affect sales,
and financial constraints shape operational decisions.

Board meeting themes
Recent board meetings have been dominated by concerns over potential supply chain
disruptions, inefficient production, sustainability, and the Cofidis contract.
Supply chain disruptions
Looking back on the last few years, the board realizes that Biclou’s supply chain is highly
vulnerable to disruptions. During the COVID-era, port shutdowns, factory closures and
shipping delays slowed the flow of carbon fiber frames and components. Shortly after,
the Suez Canal blockage caused further disruptions, leaving shipments of tires and
wheelsets stranded for weeks. More recently, Houthi rebel attacks on container ships in
the Red Sea have forced rerouted shipping around the Cape of Good Hope, increasing
both transit times and costs for shipments. These challenges have initiated discussions
about supplier diversification. Biclou's CEO and COO embarked on a mission to Eastern
Europe, aiming to assess the viability of alternative suppliers. This trip largely confirmed
their prior expectations – the region offers a skilled workforce – but they also realized that
navigating local bureaucratic intricacies and adapting to cultural nuances will require
time and dedicated resources. Unlike in East Asia, where Kenstone, Giant, and many Tier-
2 and Tier-3 suppliers operate within a dense, interconnected manufacturing network,
Eastern Europe’s supply base is much less developed and more fragmented.
Another recurring theme in board meetings is the persistent supply issues with one of
Biclou’s component suppliers. Components from this supplier frequently arrive with
quality inconsistencies, requiring additional quality control in France and forcing last-
minute scheduling adjustments. On top of this, deliveries are often delayed, further
complicating production planning. The original quality requirements and delivery
expectations were clearly outlined in the contract. While the COO admits that Biclou’s
engineering team has requested minor modifications over time, these changes were not
substantial, and the quality issues are not related to the modified elements. The COO has
become increasingly frustrated, arguing that the supplier is either deprioritizing Biclou in
favor of larger brands or cutting costs on material. Believing the supplier is not holding up
its end of the agreement, the COO suggests that Biclou should start looking for alternative
suppliers. The CFO warns that this comes with significant transaction costs and
questions whether immediately searching for a new supplier is the right approach.
Inefficient production
The COO voiced frustration that every time a Cofidis order arrives, production shifts
entirely, forcing delays on retailer orders. These disruptions, the COO argued, stem from
poor forecasting. To illustrate the issue, last year’s unexpectedly sunny February caused
a spike in early-season retailer demand. Forecasting adjustments lagged behind, so by
the time Biclou increased production of its consumer models, Cofidis placed its first
major order ahead of the Spring Classics, compounding the disruption. With forecasts
arriving too late, production remains stuck in reactive mode, preventing a stable workflow
and reducing overall efficiency. To address this, the COO suggested exploring AI-driven
forecasting models that could integrate historical trends, retailer behavior, and Cofidis’
race calendar to align production planning with actual demand. Some board members
found the potential for automation and real-time forecasting promising, while others
remained sceptical about whether an algorithm could truly replace managerial
experience and intuition in predicting cycling industry trends.

Sustainability
The sustainability team has been floating the idea of pursuing a B-Corp certification.
Unlike a few major competitors, Biclou has yet to fully assess the social and
environmental impact across its supply chain, and B-Corp provides a structured
framework to do so. The CCO is enthusiastic about the marketing potential, believing that
eco-conscious consumers will pay more for a certified sustainable brand. The CFO takes
a more cautious view, acknowledging the value of greater transparency and structured
sustainability efforts, but arguing that Biclou should first integrate double materiality into
its annual reporting, aligning with emerging EU regulations such as CSRD. The
sustainability team pushes back, insisting that B-Corp certification should not be seen as
an endpoint, but as a starting point for mapping sustainability efforts and identifying areas
for real improvement. The COO warned that Biclou has little leverage to enforce
sustainability improvements. Even if Biclou maps its environmental footprint, Kenstone,
Giant, and Shimano already follow industry standards dictated by larger brands like Trek
and Specialized. If suppliers refuse to comply with additional B-Corp requirements,
Biclou will face a choice: either accept incomplete sustainability reporting or search for
alternative suppliers.
Cofidis contract
A representative from team Visma | Lease a Bike recently approached Biclou with
interest, offering an opportunity to partner with one of the most dominant teams in the
WorldTour. The CEO sees this as a transformative branding move, one that could cement
Biclou as a premier high-performance brand and drive sales. However, the COO worries
that taking on another team will push production to the breaking point and create supply
chain chaos. Cofidis orders already disrupt consumer bike production – adding another
team would make demand even harder to forecast and balance, increasing the risk of
missed deliveries, production delays, and frustrated retailers. Complicating matters
further, Giant—Biclou’s largest supplier—is also competing for the Visma | Lease a Bike
sponsorship. This presents a strategic dilemma: if Giant wins the contract, it strengthens
its position as both a competitor and supplier, making it harder for Biclou to negotiate
favourable terms on frame purchases. If Biclou wins the contract, it risks damaging its
relationship with Giant, which could reprioritize production for other brands, delay lead
times on critical components, or limit supply flexibility. The CFO has voiced concerns
over these financial risks, questioning whether the exposure gained from a second
sponsorship outweighs the potential for supply disruptions, operational chaos, and long-
term instability.
